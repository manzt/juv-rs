# juv-rs

a rewrite of [`juv`](https://github.com/manzt/juv) in rust

> [!WARNING]

## compatability

- [x] `cat`
- [x] `init`
- [ ] `run` (partial)
- [x] `exec`
- [x] `add`
- [x] `clear`
- [ ] `edit` (partial)

## why?

I needed a mental respite post-election results.

Not planning to migrate existing code - performance gains are marginal and my
fondness of writing Rust probably doesn't justify the added release complexity.
